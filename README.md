# Lab Description
# In this lab, we learned how to structure a well-formed HTML5 webpage, add semantic elements, and implement basic HTML5 validation for a contact form. The lab focused on the following key tasks:

# HTML5 Structure: We created a simple webpage using semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. The structure included a basic navigation menu, a news section, and related links in a sidebar.

# Contact Form with Validation: We added a contact form with HTML5 validation for user inputs. This form included fields for the user's name, email, and a message, with validation rules such as required fields and minimum character lengths.

# W3C Validation: We used the W3C Validator to check our HTML code for errors and ensured that the code passed without any issues by correcting any validation errors.

# GitHub Deployment: The lab also involved uploading the project to GitHub for version control. We initialized a Git repository, committed the project files, created a GitHub repository, and pushed the code to the remote repository.t
